Vectors can be seen as 1-D tensors, and matrices as 2-D tensors\n", "* The usage of tensors reaches beyond matrices: tensors can have N dimensions\n", "* Tensors can be created and manipulated using NumPy\n", "* Keras makes building neural networks in Python easy, and you learned how to do that in this section\n", "* You can use Keras to do some NLP as well, e.g. for tokenization "]}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python (python3)", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.9.5"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2}
