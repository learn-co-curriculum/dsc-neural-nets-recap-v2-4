    "* Deep neural network presentations can lighten the burden and automate certain tasks of heavy data preprocessing\n",
    "* Deep representations need exponentially fewer hidden units than shallow networks, to obtain the same performance\n",
    "* Parameter initialization, forward propagation, cost function evualation and backward propagation are again the cornerstones of deep networks\n",
    "* Tensors are the building blocks of neural networks and a good understanding of them and how to use them in Python is crucial\n",
    "* scalars can be seen as 0D tensors. vectors can be seen as 1D tensors and Matrices are 2D tensors\n",
    "* The usage of tensors reaches beyond matrices: tensors can have N dimensions\n",
    "* Tensors can be created and manipulated using Numpy\n",
    "* Keras makes building neural networks in Python easy, and you learned how to do that in this section\n",
    "* You can use Keras to do some NLP as well, e.g. for tokenization"
